# Learning and Scribbling C++
This repository is meant for documenting C++ learnings, and scribbling through it to find out answers to questions related to how something works under the hood, how much time and space does it takes, what does it do at assembly level, how performance can be improved etc.

## Important declaration:
This repository does not belong to a single program. There is no pre-defined entry point to the directory. All files here serve as references to various concepts and implementation. They may be compiled as a standalone file or a group of files that build as a program unit.

The directories that have CMakeLists.txt, do not mean that it will include/compile all files of the given directory.
